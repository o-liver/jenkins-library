In case the build is performed for a pull request TRAVIS_COMMIT is a merge
commit between the base branch and the PR branch HEAD. That commit is actually built.
But for notifying about a build status we need the commit which is currently
the HEAD of the PR branch.

In this case there is no merge commit between any base branch and HEAD of a PR branch.
The commit which we need for notifying about a build status is in this case simply
TRAVIS_COMMIT itself.
